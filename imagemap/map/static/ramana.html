            Sri Ramanasramam is an important spiritual center located in Tiruvannamalai, Tamil Nadu, dedicated to Sri
            Ramana Maharshi, one of the most revered modern-day saints of India.

            Sri Ramanasramam was formally founded by Sri Ramana Maharshiâ€™s devotees in 1927, though it existed
            informally from 1896 when he began living in Tiruvannamalai.

                The meditation hall (also known as Sri Maharshi's Samadhi) is the most sacred site in the ashram. This is where Sri Ramana's mortal remains are entombed.
